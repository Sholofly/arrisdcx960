service_data:
  entity_id: media_player.ziggo_beneden
  media_content_id: 401 # Any channel number, 'Netflix' or 'Videoland'
  media_content_type: channel # 'channel' when media_content_id is channelnumber, 'app' when media_content_id is 'Netflix' or 'Videoland' 
```

## Custom services

This service can be called to start a recording. Note that this shows a pop-up on screen and confirmation is required.

```yaml
service: arris_dcx960.record
service_data:
  entity_id: media_player.ziggo_beneden
```

This service can be called to rewind or fast-forward. 
Note that this command can be called multiple times to speed up.
To stop this action, you can call the standard media_player.play service on the same entity.

```yaml
service: arris_dcx960.rewind
service_data:
  entity_id: media_player.ziggo_beneden

service: arris_dcx960.fast_forward
service_data:
  entity_id: media_player.ziggo_beneden
```

This service can be called to emulate a key press on the remote control.

```yaml
service: arris_dcx960.remote_key_press
service_data:
  entity_id: media_player.ziggo_beneden
  remote_key: 'MediaTopMenu'
